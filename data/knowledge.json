      "text": "Coming out of last week's DNPI Commercial meeting, <@UA3GJJ33M> and I met with <@U034VB9PCBF> & <@U062VREFQ21> today along with <@U28PAN1QE> to map out updates in the NCQA requirements. I have copied below the notes from our meeting as an FYI for the group. We have several to-dos/next steps after this conversation, and will bring an update on these to the next DNPI Commercial meeting. This topic is not specifically about the DNPI product itself, but I think it will _and should_ have impact on how we go to market and how we educate our clients.\nfyi <@UN58QJ4DS> <@U8UU31STC> <@U084DBXS3SA>\n\n*Quick recap*\nThe team discussed significant changes to NCQA health plan guidelines, particularly focusing on credentialing requirements. They explored various monitoring requirements including new requirements to monitor license expiration and check for sanctions on a monthly basis. The conversation ended with discussions about the opportunity for product enhancements and plans to create educational materials to help clients understand the new requirements.\n\n*Next steps*\n• Donna to reach out to Tsveta with questions the team had about how \"adverse events\" is defined and what the specific license expiration monitoring requirement is. \n• Donna to move her NCQA requirements documents to a shared folder to be accessible to all PT team members. \n• Commercial Dynamic NPI team to bring topic/updates to next meeting. \n• Marketing and Sales teams to continue discussions on how to optimize messaging regarding these guideline changes. \n• Donna and Marketing to explore the possibility of either doing a webinar with Tsveta or building an FAQ doc of some sort about the new guidelines. \n• Team to potentially schedule another meeting to discuss the delegation aspect of the new guidelines. \n*Summary*\n\n*NCQA Credentialing Guidelines Discussion*\nThe team discussed changes to NCQA health plan guidelines, focusing on credentialing and recredentialing sections that apply to their work. Donna highlighted a key change regarding data collection software, noting that using software to collect information does not constitute delegation unless the entity also reviews the credentialing information on behalf of the organization. This distinction is important for their argument with BCBS Tennessee, where they aim to establish that ProviderTrust is not a delegate but rather a source providing collected information for review by the health plan or its committees.\n\n*Board Certification Verification Time Limits*\nDonna and Bluebird discussed the verification time limit of 120 days for board certifications and the ability to use expired certifications for education and training verification. They explored the implications of the new requirements stating that state sanctions and restrictions on licenses must be verified for the past five years during credentialing, which could change how clients such as BCBS Tennessee think about the Dynamic NPI product. Bluebird highlighted the need to now monitor all licenses a practitioner has held in the past five years during credentialing, which contrasts with some clients' preferences to focus only on the state where they are based.\n\n*NCQA Credential Monitoring Requirements*\nDonna and Bluebird discussed NCQA requirements for monitoring healthcare provider credentials, focusing on the need to check for board actions, sanctions, and adverse events every 30 days _using primary sources._ They clarified that while license expiration date monitoring is now required ongoing, it doesn't necessarily require primary source checks. The discussion revealed conflicting interpretations between BCBS South Carolina's approach and Health Partners' practices, leading them to consider scheduling a meeting with Health Partners to clarify these requirements.\n\n*2025 Accreditation Standards Discussion*\nDonna and Bluebird discussed the 2025 standards and guidelines for accreditation and certification in credentialing and provider networks. They considered creating a webinar or FAQ document to help clients understand these new requirements. Donna agreed to reach out to Tsveta with specific questions about adverse events and license expiration. Bluebird planned to post an update in the dynamic NPI channel and suggested discussing next steps in the next commercial dynamic NPI meeting. They also talked about moving documents into a more accessible folder.",
