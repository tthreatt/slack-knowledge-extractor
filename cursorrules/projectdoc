# Slack Knowledge Extraction MVP - 4 Hour Build Plan

## Vision Statement
Build an MVP that automatically extracts, categorizes, and surfaces organizational knowledge from Slack conversations, creating searchable documentation and insights that would otherwise remain buried in chat history.

## Core Value Proposition
Transform ephemeral Slack conversations into persistent, searchable organizational memory - solving the "I know we discussed this somewhere" problem that costs teams hours weekly.

## 4-Hour Sprint Breakdown

### Hour 1: Foundation & Setup (60 min)
**Core Infrastructure**
- [ ] Set up basic Node.js/Express server with TypeScript
- [ ] Install and configure Slack SDK (@slack/web-api)
- [ ] Create Slack app with necessary OAuth scopes:
  - `channels:history` (read public channel messages)
  - `groups:history` (read private channel messages user has access to)
  - `users:read` (get user info for attribution)
- [ ] Set up environment variables and basic authentication flow
- [ ] Test connection with simple API call to verify setup

**Time Box: Stop at 60 minutes regardless of completion state**

### Hour 2: Data Extraction Core (60 min)
**Slack Data Pipeline**
- [ ] Build message fetching function with pagination
- [ ] Implement channel discovery (start with 3-5 most active channels)
- [ ] Create basic message filtering (exclude bots, system messages)
- [ ] Add rate limiting to respect Slack API limits
- [ ] Build simple data structure for extracted messages:
  ```typescript
  interface ExtractedMessage {
    id: string;
    text: string;
    user: string;
    channel: string;
    timestamp: string;
    thread_ts?: string;
    reactions?: string[];
  }
  ```
- [ ] Test extraction on sample channel

### Hour 3: Knowledge Processing (60 min)
**Intelligence Layer**
- [ ] Integrate Claude MCP for text analysis
- [ ] Build knowledge extraction pipeline:
  - Identify decision points in conversations
  - Extract action items and outcomes
  - Categorize discussions by topic/department
  - Flag important announcements or policy changes
- [ ] Create simple categorization system:
  - `decisions` - Final decisions made
  - `discussions` - Ongoing debates/considerations  
  - `resources` - Shared links, documents, tools
  - `processes` - How-to information and workflows
- [ ] Build basic deduplication (similar conversations)
- [ ] Create JSON output structure for processed knowledge

### Hour 4: MVP Interface & Demo (60 min)
**User Interface & Validation**
- [ ] Build simple web interface with:
  - Search functionality across extracted knowledge
  - Filter by category, channel, date range
  - Display context (original message + thread)
  - Export functionality (JSON/CSV)
- [ ] Create demo dataset with 2-3 channels of real data
- [ ] Build simple analytics dashboard:
  - Knowledge extraction metrics
  - Most active knowledge contributors
  - Knowledge categories breakdown
- [ ] Document setup process for other teams
- [ ] Record demo video showing value proposition

## Technical Stack Decisions

### Core Technology
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express (fast setup, great Slack SDK)
- **AI Processing**: Claude MCP (most capable for knowledge extraction)
- **Database**: JSON files initially (fastest for MVP, easy to inspect)
- **Frontend**: Simple HTML/CSS/JS (no framework overhead)
- **Hosting**: Local development (deploy later)

### MCP Integration Points
1. **Slack MCP**: For secure Slack data access if available
2. **Claude MCP**: For intelligent content analysis
3. **File System MCP**: For knowledge base storage and retrieval

## Success Metrics for 4-Hour MVP
- [ ] Successfully extract messages from 3+ Slack channels
- [ ] Process 100+ messages through knowledge extraction
- [ ] Demonstrate search functionality works on extracted knowledge
- [ ] Show clear categorization of at least 3 knowledge types
- [ ] Complete end-to-end demo in under 3 minutes

## Post-MVP Expansion Ideas (Future Sprints)
- Real-time processing of new messages
- Integration with company wiki/documentation tools
- Advanced search with semantic similarity
- Automated digest generation
- Team-specific knowledge clustering
- Integration with other communication tools (Discord, Teams)

## Risk Mitigation
- **Slack API Rate Limits**: Implement exponential backoff, batch processing
- **Large Channel History**: Start with recent messages only (last 30 days)
- **Processing Time**: Use async processing, show progress indicators
- **Data Privacy**: Process only channels user has access to, respect permissions

## Definition of Done
✅ MVP demonstrates clear value: "Find that discussion about X from 3 months ago"
✅ Reproducible setup process documented
✅ Demo-ready with real organizational data
✅ Identified clear next steps for productization

*Remember: This is an MVP - prioritize working functionality over perfect code. Ship something that proves the concept and generates user feedback.*
